### Ubunifu is a innovation hub located in Nakuru, Kenya. Our mission is to make technology literacy equitable for anyone that wants to learn. We offer a variety of different courses focused on basic computer literacy. In the areas we serve, schools don't teach computer skills, and the majority of households don't own computers or have internet access. So often times, attending a class at Ubunifu is the first time students are really becoming familiar with computers. 

### We opened our doors in May of 2021 and have since served nearly 500 students. Our students are mostly post high school aged, but anyone is welcome to take advantage of our courses. Our space is comprised of 25 computers, unlimited wifi, and two 3D printers. We are always adding new technologies to the space.
